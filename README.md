Advent of Code [2022 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions written by me to annoy people into using Rust

## running

You'll need stable rust and cargo, install instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). I also use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for convenience

```shell
$ cargo run -p day-01 --release
```

Or by using just:

```shell
$ just r day-01
```

Some days might require nightly toolchain
